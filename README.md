# Portfolio (NextJS App)

A modern, responsive portfolio frontend built with Next.js, [Hero UI], and [Tailwind CSS]. This project elegantly showcases personal blog posts, featured projects, and developer tools in a clean and performant layout. It includes dynamic routing, optimized image handling, and a theme toggle for dark/light modeâ€”perfect for developers who want to present their work and writing with style and clarity.

The backend is powered by Prisma, a robust ORM, and PostgreSQL as the database, ensuring efficient data management and scalability.

This project was bootstrapped using create-next-app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
